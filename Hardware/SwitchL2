A switch is a Layer 2 (L2) network device that connects devices within the same local network (LAN). Here’s the clear breakdown:

✅ What is a Switch?

A switch is a networking device that:

Operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model

Uses MAC addresses to forward frames

Connects devices like PCs, servers, printers, access points within a LAN

It creates separate collision domains for each port, improving network performance.

✅ Is a Switch Layer 2?

Yes — by default, a switch is an L2 device.
It uses MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions.

However:

L2 Switch → works only at Layer 2 (Switching)

L3 Switch → works at Layer 2 + Layer 3 (Routing)
So not all switches are strictly L2—some are L3 or multilayer.

✅ Where Is It Configured on a Server?

A switch is not configured on a server.

A switch is an external hardware device in the network.
You configure it by connecting to the switch itself, not to a server.

You configure a switch using:

Console/Serial port (initial setup)

SSH or Telnet (remote management)

Web GUI (if it’s a smart or managed switch)

Configuration happens on the switch OS (e.g., Cisco IOS, Juniper JunOS, HP ProCurve OS), not on a server.

🖥️ If you're referring to “switching” inside a server:

Sometimes people confuse:

Network switch (hardware)

Virtual switch (vSwitch) inside virtualization platforms

A Virtual Switch exists in:

VMware ESXi

Hyper-V

Proxmox

KVM

These are software switches inside the server, but they are still L2 switching devices.
